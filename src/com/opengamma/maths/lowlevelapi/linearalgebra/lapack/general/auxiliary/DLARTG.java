 * Computes planar rotations (often called Given's or Jacobi rotations)

 * Algorithm is taken from: 
 * "Discontinuous Plane Rotations and the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem", Edward Anderson, Lockheed Martin Services Inc., Anderson.Edward@epa.gov
 * http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lawnspdf/lawn150.pdf
 * It forms part of the LAPACK library which is provided under a modified BSD licensed.
 * This algorithm is chosen as it produces a more continuous set of rotations whilst also avoiding under/overflow
 * (as outlined in "Matrix Computations, Third Edition" Golub and Van Loan p216, Alg. 5.1.3,
 *  which is essentially the same idea but with the discontinuity is the sign still present).
