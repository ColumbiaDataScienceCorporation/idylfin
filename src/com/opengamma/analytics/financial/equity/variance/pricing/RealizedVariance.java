 *  Model-independent Realized Variance result of the swap based upon observations already made.<p>
 *  Notes on market-standard form :<p>
 *  Computed as the average daily variance of log returns,then scaled by an annualizationFactor, an estimate of the number of business days per year<p>
 *  In this calculation, the average is taken over the actual number of observations provided. 
 *  In Variance instruments, the number of actual observations may be less than number expected,
 *  due to unforeseen market disruptions. To account for this, the sum is normalized by nObsExpected (>= nObsActual) 
 *  This is adjusted for in the model's presentValue method , not here. See VarSwapStaticReplication.presentValue
