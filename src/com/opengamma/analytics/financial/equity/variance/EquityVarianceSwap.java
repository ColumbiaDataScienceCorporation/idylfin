/**
 * An Equity Variance Swap is a forward contract on the realised variance of equity index or single stock. It differs from the more general Variance Swap only in that dividends
 * are paid on equity and the treatment of these in the computation of the realised variance depends on the contract. Dividends are either corrected for (i.e. the realised variance is
 * that of the total returns process - the position where <b>all</b> dividend payments are immediately reinvested in the stock) or not - either way, the expected variance (the variance
 * strike of a zero value swap) will differ from the no dividend case.
