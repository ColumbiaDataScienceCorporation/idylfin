Quantitative Finance Library for Java by Idylwood Technologies

Goal:
To provide a wrapper to Yahoo Finance API as well as a library consisting of financial, statistical and numerical methods to analyze the data.

Features:
Pure 100% Java implementation which is fast _and_ numerically stable
Fast -- e.g. matrix vector multiplication which is 10% faster than OpenGamma's Java BLAS implementation
Numerically stable -- no other Java numerics library is implemented with numerical stability in mind
Thread safe design
Lightweight

API to Yahoo Finance
Sharpe Ratio and other financial statistics
Split and dividend adjustment
Functionality which is similar to some R packages, but *much* faster (e.g. CVAR calulation which is around 70 TIMES faster!)

Dependencies:
IdylFin currently depends on Apache Commons Math, sections of OpenGamma, Jsoup and GRAL, forks of which are included in this source tree. In future versions the dependencies may be removed so that the code is self contained.
